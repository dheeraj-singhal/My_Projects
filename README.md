### DOCKER-COMPOSE
Testing WordPress plugins can be difficult, especially during development, when you want the feedback loops to be small. A local development environment can help. This enables you to test your plugin on a local WordPress installation, running on your own computer, without the need for a live website. However, setting one up can be difficult, resource-intensive and error-prone. Especially when you use a full-fledged virtual machine (VM) like Vagrant to run your local webserver.  
 
In this project, I have created WordPress development environment and wp core install using Docker instead. Docker uses containers to run software in isolation from each other. However, it does not need a full and heavy VM because it makes use of the capabilities of the underlying operating system. This makes a WordPress development environment in Docker a lot smaller, faster and easier to set up.
